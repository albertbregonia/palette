	Lobby is a container that manages a collection of users.

	Lobby utilizes a thread safe map that uses usernames as keys and uses pointers to `User` instances as the values.
	Similar to `Manager`, upon creation, the constructor will start up the `userManager()` goroutine. This goroutine
	will poll the users in the map and see if the user has exceeded the lobby's maximum timeout period and delete their
	data from the lobby.
